                        <p>Hey guys! I'm a beginner, only started first week of September. For my next project, I'm
                            thinking of making a note taking app but it's sorta like a 'wishlist' for items you wanna
                            buy. I'm planning for it to have the following basic features (will add more once i get the
                            basics down):

                            You can add and delete items

                            You can log in and save your notes (im thinking that means i need to learn some kind of
                            database tech but idk what)

                            Each item-note you can also add an image

                            I can probably work out all of those with just html,css and vanilla JavaScript except the
                            part where users can log in and out. So where do I get started?Hey guys! I'm a beginner, only started first week of September. For my next project, I'm
